# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
Before becoming a coffee-to-code converter, I used to be extremely curious about science and engineering, and I tried to get my hands dirty with all sorts of garage experiences, including building electronic devices, miniature ships, wooden bridges,... but then I discovered what magic things can be done with programming, and it all started there: a couple of years abundant with exhilarating "It works :satisfied: !" moments, and some other "what's wrong with it :weary:" tribulations.

During those very couples of years, I got my *M.Sc.* in Electronics Engineering, worked as a Data Scientist in an AI consulting company, and as a Software Engineer in a leading *reviews-as-a-service* provider.

When I'm not coffee-digesting, I do improvisation theater, I work on my public speaking skills with Toastmasters, or I travel with a good book in my backpack :steam_locomotive:.
