# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,
<br>
<br>
Since a young age, I have always been extremely curious about science and engineering, and I tried to get my hands dirty with all sorts of garage experiences, including building electronic devices, miniature ships, wooden bridges,... and then I discovered what magic things can be done with programming, and it all started there: a couple of years abundant with exhilarating "It works :satisfied: !" moments, and some other "what's wrong with it :weary:" tribulations.

When I'm not working on tech stuff, I do improvisation theater, I practice Brazilian Jiu-jitsu, or I travel with a good book in my backpack :steam_locomotive:.
